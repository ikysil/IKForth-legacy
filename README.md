A few facts:

* 32 bits code
* Runs on Linux and Windows (tested with Wine)
* Supports Indirect and Direct Threaded Code representations
* Image-based system
* x86 assembler is used to bootstrap image capable of interpreting from files
* Image is NOT relocatable - absolute 32 bits addresses are used in native and threaded code
* CELL size is 32 bits
* CHAR size is 8 bits
* addressable unit - 1 byte (8 bits)
